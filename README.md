# Generating-a-baseball-team-wirh-Interfaces-and-Polymorphism
This was my first attempt at understand and implementing interfaces and polymorphism into an otherwise simple program.

A baseball team has two types of players on it: pitchers and batters. The statistics that are of interest for pitchers are wins, losses, and ERA (earned run average). The statistics of interest for batters are home runs and batting average.

Create an interface player that has a method void showStats() which displays the appropriate statistics for each player. Two classes batter and pitcher have the playerâ€™s name and salary instance variables, and will implement the player interface and further describe the players. Each class should also have suitable constructor functions.

Then, create a main() that creates an array of players called team and test each of your methods. Your main() method will constitute your test cases.
